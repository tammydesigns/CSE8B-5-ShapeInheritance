Program Description:
Overall this program allows the user to create common shapes and display them on a digital board.
The shapes that are supported are rectangles, sqaures, circles, triangles, lines and any other polygon.
The program can also fill color into them. The program will tell you about the detailed locations of the
shapes. 
The way to create different shapes are as follows:
Line/Triangle/Polygon: Give the program all the vertices of the shape.
Rectangle/Sqaure: Give the program the upper left vertex of the shape and the length and width.
Circle: Give the program the center point and the radius.

Short Response:
1.
Change the x and y values of line1 and see whether line1 and line2 still have the same x and y values.
If not, then it's probably a deep copy.
2.
Seperately create two new Objects that have exactly the same instance variables. And then use the equals
method. If it says false, then it's probably a shallow comparaison.
